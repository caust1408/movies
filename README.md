dataset HW
This is my movie dataset for javascript class
For this program you go into the filter file and change what you want to search for at the bottom, following the same format that I have already put in. Then you run d8 filter.js and your results will print out on the screen.

I filtered which movies are classified as a drama genre 
For reduce I used it to find the earliest movie on the list
For map I will do the title and rating of each movie

The date.js file gives you how many days since it was first released

I am doing the Golf exercise for chapter 9
