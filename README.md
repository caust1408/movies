Class: CMP237
Turned in: 3-20-15
Ran with: d8
File(s) to run: filter.js,reduce.js,date.js
Assignment:create a dataset of your choosing and create a reduce,filter and create a date function.

//filter.js
For this program you go into the filter file and change what you want to search for at the bottom, following the same format that I have already put in. 

// reduce.js
I filtered which movies are classified as a drama genre 
For reduce I used it to find the earliest movie on the list
For map I will do the title and rating of each movie

// date.js
The date.js file gives you how many days since it was first released
The program works by running the date.js file and then it outputs how many days since that movie was released.

I am doing the Golf exercise for chapter 9
