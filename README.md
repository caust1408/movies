dataset HW

This is my movie dataset for javascript class
//filter.js
For this program you go into the filter file and change what you want to search for at the bottom, following the same format that I have already put in. Then you run d8 filter.js and your results will print out on the screen.

// reduce.js
I filtered which movies are classified as a drama genre 
For reduce I used it to find the earliest movie on the list
For map I will do the title and rating of each movie


// date.js
The date.js file gives you how many days since it was first released
Turned in on 3-20-15
Ran with d8
The program works by running the date.js file and then it outputs how many days since that movie was released.

I am doing the Golf exercise for chapter 9
